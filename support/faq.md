### What is Midas Capital? <a href="#what-is-rari-capital" id="what-is-rari-capital"></a>

Midas Capital is bringing isolated and customizable money markets to EVM-compatible blockchains. Enabling users, DAOs, and protocols to create customized and isolated pools for lending and borrowing any asset, Midas is building a cross-chain ecosystem that democratizes money markets. Pool creators have the flexibility to modify pool parameters (interest rate curves, oracles, collateral factors, pool fee, etc.) according to their risk appetite. With isolated pools, Midas offers stellar features for large-scale institutions, protocols, and traditional investors.

### **What are Midas pools?**&#x20;

Midas pools are permissionless money markets that allow anyone to create customized and isolated pools for lending and borrowing of any asset. Pool creators have the flexibility to modify various parameters (interest rate curves, oracles, collateral factors, etc.) according to their risk appetite.&#x20;

### **What is a money market?**

&#x20;Money markets are marketplaces that allow you to lend and borrow your assets.&#x20;

### **Why isolated pools?**&#x20;

Isolated pools allow the isolation of risks to individual pools and groups of assets. The risks of assets in a specific pool won’t affect assets in other pools or the broader protocol. (edited)

### **Isolated Pools vs Non-isolated Money Market Platforms**&#x20;

Non-isolated money markets like Compound and AAVE have a limited set of assets that can be used for borrowing and lending – new assets need to be approved through governance. Since all the assets are pooled together, the risk of a single asset can impact all the assets within the protocol. With isolated pools, any protocol or DAO can create a new pool for any group of assets, allowing for a broader variety of assets to be used as collateral or to be borrowed.&#x20;

### **What is the ERC 4626 token standard?**&#x20;

ERC 4626 is a contract standard for yield-bearing tokens issued by Vaults or other protocols. Extending the ERC-20 token standard, ERC 4626 helps in standardizing vaults. All applications built on top of ERC-4626 vaults work with all other yield-bearing ERC-4626 vaults, enabling easy integration.&#x20;

### **What is Flywheel?**&#x20;

Built by Tribe DAO using Foundry and Solmate, Flywheel is a collection of open-source token incentives and governance infrastructure using modern and modular solidity patterns. The two major components of Flywheel are the core incentives engine and ERC20 token utilities.
