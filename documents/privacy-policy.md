**Privacy & The Blockchain**

\\

A key feature of many blockchain technologies, including any blockchain on which the Company’s services rely, is the transparency and public accessibility of on-chain transactions. This includes but is in no way limited to your public sending address (“**public key**”) and any other information that you choose to include. Additionally, information stored on-chain may be public, immutable, and not easily removed or deleted and, in many cases, cannot be deleted. Your public addresses may reveal information about you and this information can potentially be correlated now or in the future by any party who chooses to do so, including law enforcement. If you are unfamiliar with blockchain technology and its transparent and public nature, we strongly encourage you to conduct your own research into blockchain before electing to use our services.

\\

**Your Choices**

\\

We strive to provide you with choices regarding the personal information you provide to us. We have created mechanisms to provide you with the following control over your information:

To learn how you can manage your Flash cookie settings, visit the Flash player settings page on Adobe's [website](https://www.adobe.com/privacy/cookies.html).

This applies to any private keys you may use in relation to our Website or our services. We strongly encourage you not to share your password or private keys with anyone.

\\

Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information transmitted to our Website.
