# DeFi Terms Glossary

### Address (Wallet) <a href="#address-wallet" id="address-wallet"></a>

A digital wallet with address (0x...) allows you to receive transactions on the blockchain. The address is a character string that is used as your "personal identification".

### APY <a href="#apy" id="apy"></a>

Annual percentage yield represents the rate of return for your interest accrued. Unlike annual percentage rate (APR), APY stresses the idea of compound interest that you are earning in DeFi. To calculate your daily ROI, divide APY by 365 for the daily rate.

### Arbitrage <a href="#arbitrage" id="arbitrage"></a>

Oftentimes in inefficient markets, you have many opportunities to profit off of imbalances. This can happen with asset prices being different depending on the exchange or switching between interest rates.

### Audit <a href="#audit" id="audit"></a>

Security and smart contract risk is the most important aspect of DeFi. All protocols should have their smart contract audited, which allows a third-party service into the codebase to check for potential bugs or vulnerabilities that may have not been noticed by the engineering team.

### Automated Market Maker (AMM) <a href="#automated-market-maker-amm" id="automated-market-maker-amm"></a>

Market makers play a huge role in DeFi, as they play the roles of ensuring liquidity on both the buyer and sellerâ€™s end. An automated market maker is a smart contract that creates liquidity pools of specific tokens which are traded algorithmically rather than individual trading. Liquidity providers (LP) earn fees based on their liquidity provisions in creating market efficiency.

### IOU Token <a href="#iou-token" id="iou-token"></a>

Token that represents your share in the pool.

### Lending Aggregator <a href="#lending-aggregator" id="lending-aggregator"></a>

Algorithmic based system that maximizes your yield across lending protocols.

### Liquidation <a href="#liquidation" id="liquidation"></a>

When trading on leverage, you supply the collateral to support your borrowed position. If the price of the asset at hand falls below the price determined by your collateralization ratio, then your position is liquidated.
