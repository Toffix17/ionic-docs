# Overview

Whether you are a DAO, an entity, or an individual, there are many reasons you might be interested in having your own isolated pool — or at least one that fits your needs, without compromises.

In this section, we’ll explore all the knobs & levers that are available to you, and how our platform can benefit your own project and its community.

Everything described in this documentation is a service we offer free of charge, forever.
