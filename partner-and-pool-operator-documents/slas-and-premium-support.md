# SLAs & Premium Support

While we commit to keep the core of our product free forever for our partners, we also strive to maintain a reasonable SLA for requests for everyone. These goals sometimes come into conflict — as the number of partnerships grows, so does the operational burden of supporting an ever greater set use-cases and custom integrations.

It is in light of this that we have developed a Premium Offering aimed at giving certain partners a higher level of support, as well as features as a set of quality-of-life features for the partners and their users. Here they are:
