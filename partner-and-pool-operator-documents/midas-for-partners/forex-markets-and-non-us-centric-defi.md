# Forex Markets & Non-US Centric DeFi

Since Midas enables pool creators to set up custom and isolated money markets with a variety of supported assets, the platform can have multiple Forex markets running simultaneously across multiple chains.

Therefore, the pools enable users to:

* **Collateralize Blue Chip Assets For Native Currencies**: These pools allow users to utilise their blue chip assets, such as wBTC, wETH, BNB, MATIC, and many others, to borrow their native currencies without selling their original assets.
  * [**Jarvis jFIAT**](https://app.midascapital.xyz/137/pool/1)
