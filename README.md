# Welcome to Ionic

## **Product**

### Ionic protocol

A plug and play, end to end solution comprised of customizable isolated asset pool infrastructure, supported by a comprehensive security monitoring and failsafe system, neatly packaged in a robust SDK. With features such as leveraged liquidity, yield compounding, veToken mining and yield optimizers, combined with unrivalled asset support, the SDK offers extreme efficiency via a tiered pool structure for any DeFi and TradFi protocols.

## **What is Ionic?**

_Protocol, Interface, Core Team_

There are 3 parts to "Ionic," and it is important to recognize the differences between each party involved.

**The Ionic Protocol:** A DeFi protocol that is built using Smart Contracts and run autonomously on EVM compatible blockchains in order to put crypto assets to use.

**The Ionic Pro UI:** A web app that provides easy to use tooling in order to interact with the decentralized protocol. This interface is one of the many ways of interacting with the Smart Contracts.

**The Core Team:** The core Ionic team that helps protocols to establish their own isolated pools.
