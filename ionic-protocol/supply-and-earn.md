# Supply & Earn

Ionic's money market, built on an over-collateralization model, streamlines the process for users to supply assets, secure loans, and earn points (later $ION) as rewards for their activities.

Supply any of the available assets through Ionic dashboard and start earning interest, alongside with Ionic points and Mode incentive program.

## How to supply?

Head over to the "Markets" section of the dApp, choose the asset you would like to supply and click "Supply/Withdraw" button. In the pop-up window choose the amount you want to supply and either enable it as collateral or not (enabling asset as collateral will allow you to borrow against it, [more details in the next section](borrow.md)). Once the 'approve spend' and 'deposit' transaction goes through, you will **start earning supply interest + points associated with the asset**.&#x20;

## How to withdraw?

Use the same "Supply/Withdraw" button from the "Markets" section of the dApp, then switch to the withdraw part of the pop-up window. Choose the amount you want to withdraw, and once the transaction goes through, your asset will be returned to you wallet.&#x20;

**NOTE:** if you have any outstanding borrows, you will only be able to withdraw 90% out of maximum possible amount, this is done to protect users from liquidations due to under-collateralisation of their loan. If you wish to withdraw maximum amount, first you will need to repay your loan.&#x20;
