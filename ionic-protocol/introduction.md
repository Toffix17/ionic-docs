## In Code We Trust

Ionic's lending operations are fully governed by a code-centric environment, eliminating traditional intermediaries and streamlining the lending process. It incorporates an automated system that dynamically adjusts lending and borrowing rates based on set criteria, such as changes in the pool's capital utilization rate.&#x20;

As an example, if there's an increase in capital utilization, interest rates automatically rise, motivating borrowers to repay their loans more quickly or attract additional suppliers. This method ensures a continual balance of liquidity, offering users a more secure and stable platform experience.
