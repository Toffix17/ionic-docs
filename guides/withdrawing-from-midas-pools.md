# Withdrawing From Midas pools

**Step 1: Re-Paying Loans**

When you are ready to return back the borrowed asset, you will follow the same steps above in reverse.

1.  Select the asset that you are currently borrowing and press the re-pay tab.

    _Note: You will have an option to re-pay the max amount or type in your desired amount_

**Step 2: Removing Collateral/Supplied Asset**

If you would like to stop earning interest on your supplied asset and regain ownership of it in your  wallet, it is time to remove the token from the Midas pool.

_Note: In the background, you have now redeemed your fToken for the underlying amount that we discussed earlier. This is an example of a decentralized system as the protocol never took custody of your funds._

1.  Select the asset that you are currently supplying and press the withdraw tab.

    _Note: You will have an option to withdraw the max amount or type in your desired amount_
