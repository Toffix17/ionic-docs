# Midas pools

### Introduction

Midas Capital is an open interest rate protocol that allows users to lend and borrow digital assets. The Midas protocol enables anyone to instantly create and deploy their own lending and borrowing pool.&#x20;

The protocol allows users (individuals, protocols, DAOs, institutions) to choose all of their custom parameters and isolate risk, rather than using a large lending and borrowing pool on other platforms.&#x20;

Pools can be made public or private depending on the creator's preference.

### Fees

By default, 10% of all interest paid by borrowers or earned by lenders is distributed to the treasury.&#x20;

### Permissionless Lending and Borrowing Purpose

As Uniswap is to permissionless trading markets, Midas pool has permissionless lending and borrowing. If there is an asset that has on-chain liquidity, it can be supported within Midas pools via a pre-built or custom oracle.&#x20;

### How does the Midas pools compare to other money market protocols?

The nature of Midas Protocol completely removes the need to lobby to money market protocols such as Compound Finance or Aave. Generally, newer tokens to the ecosystem have a very low chance of being listed on these large money markets given their possible risk to the rest of the pool.&#x20;

Midas Protocol allows for isolated versions of Compound Finance which provides users' with full range of composability with their digital assets and the financial freedom not seen in the traditional banking industry.&#x20;
